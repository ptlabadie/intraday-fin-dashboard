# intraday-fin-dashboard
This is a dashboard that shows intraday financial data (equity and derivative quotes every 5-minutes) for each stock in the S&amp;P500. To create this dataset, I used python and Questrade's API. While the dashboard is updated daily, the data is stored on my local machine.

I created this dataset since intraday option quotes were so difficult (and expensive!) to come by. I plan on using the full dataset for further analysis. More to come soon!
